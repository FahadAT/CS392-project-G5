<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Ordered broadcast sent with receiverPermission with minimum SDK under 21</h2>
A broadcast, sendOrderedBroadcast which specifies the 
receiverPermission, but may still be vulnerable to interception, due to 
the permission squatting vulnerability in API levels before 21. This 
means any application, installed prior to the expected receiver(s) on 
the device can potentially receive this broadcast. You should 
investigate this for potential data leakage. <br><br>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

means a malicious application, without appropriate permissions, can 
bypass its permission check by using your applicationpermission to get 
access to otherwise denied resources. Use - checkCallingPermission

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Webview enables content access</h2>
While not a vulnerability by itself, it appears this app does not 
explicitly disable Content Provider access from WebViews. If the 
WebViews take in untrusted input, this can allow for data theft. To 
validate this vulnerability, load the following local file in this 
WebView: file://qark/poc/html/WV_CPA_WARNING.html <br><br>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

Failing to protect receiver tags could leave them vulnerable to attack 
by malicious apps. The receiver tags should be reviewed for 
vulnerabilities, such as injection and information leakage. <br><br>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Ordered broadcast sent with receiverPermission with minimum SDK under 21</h2>
A broadcast, sendOrderedBroadcast which specifies the 
receiverPermission, but may still be vulnerable to interception, due to 
the permission squatting vulnerability in API levels before 21. This 
means any application, installed prior to the expected receiver(s) on 
the device can potentially receive this broadcast. You should

<h2>WARNING Potientially vulnerable check permission function called</h2>
Be careful with use of Check permission function
App maybe vulnerable to Privilege escalation or Confused Deputy Attack. 
This function can grant access to malicious application, lacking the 
appropriate permission, by assuming your applications permissions. This 
means a malicious application, without appropriate permissions, can 
bypass its permission check by using your applicationpermission to get 
access to otherwise denied resources. Use - checkCallingPermission 
instead. Reference:

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Broadcast sent with receiverPermission with minimum SDK under 21</h2>
A broadcast, sendBroadcast which specifies the receiverPermission, but 
may still be vulnerable to interception, due to the permission squatting
 vulnerability in API levels before 21. This means any application, 
installed prior to the expected receiver(s) on the device can 
potentially receive this broadcast. You should investigate this for 
potential data leakage. <br><br>

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.

<h2>WARNING Insecure functions found</h2>
The Content provider API provides a method call. The framework does no 
permission checking on this entry into the content provider besides the 
basic ability for the application to get access to the provider at all. 
Any implementation of this method must do its own permission checks on 
incoming calls to make sure they are allowed. Failure to do so will 
allow unauthorized components to interact with the content provider.
